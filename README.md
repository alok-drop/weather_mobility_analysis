# Does winter affect Toronto's mobility patterns? 

## The obvious answer is yes, but let's dig deeper...

### Hypothesis 1:

Increased snowfall increases public transport delays.

   - By analysing Government of Canada (GOC) weather data, and Toronto Transit
      commision (TTC) delay data, we should be able to visualize and correlate
      the two data sets and see if a relationship exists.  
    
   - Data Sources:
   
	- GOC Weather Data: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html
	- TTC Delay Data(Bus and Streetcar): https://open.toronto.ca/catalogue/?search=ttc%20delay%20data&sort=score%20desc
  
   - Relevant IPython notebooks:
   
	- snow_delay.ipynb: Initial setup of data processing and visualization workflow
	- snow_delay_full_data.ipynb: Applying data processing workflow from the above notebook 
	  on 4 years of TTC delay data. Initial results presented at the bottom of the notebook.
